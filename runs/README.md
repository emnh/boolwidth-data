All .tar.gz archives contain a folder called 'output',
with XML-formatted boolean decompositions for the graphs in graphLib folder.

The logs folder contains stdout from runs.

These are included for comparison with old results.

I don't remember which ones are best.

Should rerun and post new ones later.
